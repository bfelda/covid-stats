# Getting started with the Covid Data Application

This project allows you to search by country to view Covid-19 statistics for that country, as well as view a top 10 reference list covering statistics of world wide Covid-19 rates.

## Viewing a countries statistics

To view a countries statistics, click on the text input and start typing your selected countries name. When you see it appear, hit enter and your country will load. You will notice the map in the background changes to the country you selected, and the data on the map reflects that country you selected.

## Manipulating the reference table

The darker section houses the reference table where you can view the top ten countries. Sort by confirmed cases, recovered, and deaths. Also aggregate those categories by total or daily.
